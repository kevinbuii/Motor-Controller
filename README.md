# Motor-Controller
Adjustable DC Motor Controller for ATMega324PB in C Language

# NOTE
I do want to say that the i2c.c, i2c.h, SSD1306.c, and SSD1306.h were all provided for me. These were used to get the LCD screen to work, as well as multiple peripherals. 

# Description 
This is a program to control a DC motor by using a joystick.
